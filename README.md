Course Rough and Irritating

Another attempt at making a game, but didn't get very far on it. Regardless, going to showcase the bones here. Wrote most of the code outside of the Unity boilerplate myself (C#), and also created mostly all of the art by hand in Aseprite, outside of some particle effects. 

This game is a tribute to one of my favorite indie games back on the Xbox360, "Zombie Estate". Premise is simple, 3/4-ish view shooter with waves of enemies and upgradable weapons. Some key mechanics I was hoping to achieve: 
- Weapon upgrade system. Maybe money from enemies, and a store?
- Potential multiplayer functionality
- Weapon types, fun designs

Clearly did not get where I wanted to with this one, but still happy with what I achieved. Some key things I faced during development: 
- Had a lot of fun trying to get the projectile system to work for the gun. The particle would spawn in the wrong place, weird trajectories, wouldn't register impacts, etc. Took a lot of tweaking to get it to work how it does, with particle effects hitting the wall.
- Spent far too long creating tilesets for the map. Creating a subset of tiles is a common way in games to create the building blocks for maps. To make sure the repetition isn't too jarring, made some variations such as windows.
- Speaking of windows, the intention is to shoot out of them. Didn't get this far, but have ideas on how it could work.

Similar to my other game projects, this one lost steam as other commitments came up. Hope to revisit the idea when I have some more spare time. Not much there, but check it out!
